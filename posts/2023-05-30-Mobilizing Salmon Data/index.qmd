# Introduction

There exists a mountain of data about salmon, their environment, and abundance yet we struggle to understand why or predict when certain populations of salmon decline. Part of the challenge is that salmon have a complicated life history where they are exposed to multiple environments throughout their lives. Some parts of their lives are easier to observe than others and some environments are more complex than others. The challenge is to figure out what observations have the most predictive power in each life phase, and then put all those data together to glean a complete history of the conditions encountered by specific salmon stocks.

However, because salmon cross arbitrary municipal, provincial, and national borders we lack a coordinated approach to aggregating data. Data often are collected using bespoke standards, stored locally, and not shared. Data management is not a trivial task. Therefore, any coordinated approach needs to be lightweight and flexible such that the barrier to adherence is surmountable by individual biologists and fall in line with the basic tenets of FAIR data[@wilkinson2016].

The truth is we don't need to develop any new technologies to mobilize salmon data, we need only implement the current technologies that exist and make it clear that they must be used, and easy to use.

## Practical Steps to Mobilize Salmon Data

1.  **Publish data**: In the pursuit of transparency, academic journals should mandate data publication and citation for manuscripts. Similarly, institutions can require the delivery of published data.

2.  **Create a Data Management Plan (DMP)**: A robust DMP is crucial for the effective management of data. Fisheries and Oceans Canada already prescribes this requirement ([**https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/datapolicy-politiquedonnees/index-eng.html#6-5**](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/datapolicy-politiquedonnees/index-eng.html#6-5)). The Government of Canada's Tri-agency Research Data Management Policy and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries Tri-agency supported DMP Assistant tool can aid in the creation of DMPs.

3.  **Publish metadata records**: Metadata records can be published on platforms like Open Canada Data Portal, CIOOS, and Dryad.

4.  **Publish Protocols**: The publication of protocols ensures uniformity in data collection and analysis.

5.  **Use Persistent Identifiers**: Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) like DOIs for datasets, ORCIDs for individuals, and RORs for organizations can ensure precise identification. Scientists can join the DataCite Canada Consortium and register on ORCID. Moreover, leveraging the PID graph can help map bespoke subsets to gain an enhanced understanding of the research landscape.

6.  **Adopt domain-specific data and metadata standards**: Implementing domain-specific data and metadata standards, such as Darwin Core for biological data and Climate Forecast Conventions for oceanographic data, ensures uniformity and compatibility across data sets. For primary biodiversity data, the Canadian Journal of Aquatic Fisheries Sciences strongly advocates for all species distribution records to be deposited in publicly accessible databases like the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) nodes ([**www.gbif.org**](http://www.gbif.org/)), BioFresh ([**www.freshwaterbiodiversity.eu**](http://www.freshwaterbiodiversity.eu/)) for freshwater data, and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS, [**http://www.iobis.org/**](http://www.iobis.org/)) for marine biodiversity data.

7.  **Promote and incentivize data publishing**: Encourage the scientific community to publish their data by offering incentives, rewards, and institutional recognition.

8.  **Review Data Management Plans**: Implement an evaluative process to review DMPs and disburse funds for data transformation post-review, ensuring optimal data management.

9.  **Reuse data**: Promote the reuse of data, leveraging the vast amount of existing information to streamline new research and reduce duplication of efforts.

10. **Cite reused data**: Any reused data should be properly cited using its digital object identifier (DOI). This practice will ensure due acknowledgment to the original data creators and promote transparency and ethical data usage.

The process of aggregating and understanding salmon data has historically been fraught with difficulties due to the complicated life history of the species and the geographical and political boundaries that often hamper a coordinated approach. The need of the hour is a simplified, flexible, and coordinated strategy that is easy to implement and adheres to the FAIR principles. The effective mobilization of salmon data does not hinge on the creation of new technologies. Rather, the emphasis should be on the active implementation of existing technologies, ensuring they are easy to use and their use is mandated. The ten strategic points delineated here present a holistic roadmap towards this objective. With concerted efforts and strategic implementation of these proposed strategies, a comprehensive understanding of salmon population dynamics can become achievable.
